# WebClient enhancements (fork)

This fork adds three **additive, backward-compatible** features to the end-user
WebClient file browser. Nothing in the SFTP/FTP/WebDAV protocols, authentication,
crypto, or the virtual-filesystem sandbox is changed; every feature lives in the
web/HTTP layer and reuses the existing per-user permission checks. Existing
endpoints keep their behavior — only new routes and new optional query params /
config keys were added.

## 1. Drag-and-drop move

Drag a file or folder row onto another folder to move it there, or onto the
breadcrumb to move it up one level. It reuses the existing
`/web/client/file-actions/move` endpoint and its task-status polling — there is
**no** new backend code. It is only enabled for users with rename permission and
is automatically disabled while viewing search results (whose items span
folders).

## 2. Recursive search (wildcard + partial)

The toolbar search box now searches the current directory **and everything
beneath it**.

- New endpoint: `GET /web/client/search?path=<start dir>&q=<query>`
- Wildcard/glob matching when `q` contains `*` or `?` (via `path.Match`),
  otherwise case-insensitive substring ("partial") matching.
- Results use the exact same JSON row shape as `/web/client/dirs`, with an extra
  `path` field naming each hit's parent folder. A "Location" column is revealed
  in the UI so results are navigable.
- The walk goes through the user's permissions per directory and is bounded by
  safety caps (5000 directories / 2000 results) so recursive listing on cloud
  backends (S3/GCS/Azure) can't run away; when a cap is hit the walk stops early
  and logs it, returning partial results.

## 3. Photo/video thumbnails + grid view

Image and (when ffmpeg is available) video files show small cached thumbnails in
the listing, and a toolbar toggle switches to a gallery/grid view. Clicking a
photo in the grid opens the existing lightbox.

- New endpoint: `GET /web/client/thumbnail?path=<file>` returns a ~200px JPEG.
- Files are always opened **through the user's connection**, so the storage
  backend and sandbox are respected. Any failure returns `404` and the UI falls
  back to a generic icon — the main listing never depends on this endpoint.
- Supported image sources: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `webp`, `bmp`.
- Video sources (`mp4`, `mov`, `mkv`, `webm`, `avi`, `m4v`) require **ffmpeg**.
  If ffmpeg is not found, video thumbnails are disabled and videos fall back to
  a generic icon; images still work.
- Thumbnails are cached on disk keyed by user + path + mod time + size, and
  served with `ETag`/`If-None-Match` (304) support.

### ffmpeg (optional, for video thumbnails)

Install ffmpeg and make sure it is on `PATH` (or set `ffmpeg_path`). For example:

```sh
# Debian/Ubuntu
apt-get install -y ffmpeg
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg
```

### Configuration (`sftpgo.json` → `httpd.thumbnails`)

All keys are optional; thumbnails are enabled by default.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Globally enable/disable thumbnail generation. |
| `cache_dir` | `""` | Cache directory (absolute or relative to the config dir). Empty → `<os temp dir>/sftpgo-thumbnails`. |
| `cache_max_size` | `512` | Max total cache size in MB; oldest thumbnails are evicted past this. `0` = unlimited. |
| `max_source_size` | `100` | Max source file size in MB to thumbnail; larger files fall back to an icon. |
| `ffmpeg_path` | `""` | Path to the ffmpeg binary. Empty → look it up in `PATH`. |

Every key can also be set via environment variable, e.g.
`SFTPGO_HTTPD__THUMBNAILS__ENABLED=false`.
